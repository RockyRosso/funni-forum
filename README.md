# Funni Forum

Funni Forum was an internet forum project being worked on by me primarily, with a few additions being worked on by a friend.

This forum was intended for my school as a way for students to communicate with one another, and discuss topics. Sadly, this never took off, with students quickly losing interest in the project. 

Since I do not intend on maintaining this any time in the near future, I've decided to open the code to the public to demonstrate how I handle complex applications such as this one, as well as possibly give a reference for those seeking to do the same thing I did. Although there are probably some practices I used which may not be recommended, so keep that in mind.

## **KEEP IN MIND**

This is for pure reference ONLY and MAY NOT be used to host yourself. Although borrowing small snippets of code from the project is acceptable as long as they're ONLY SNIPPETS and not a fully developed system.
